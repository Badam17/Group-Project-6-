# Game Title
Dinner Defender, November 2022

## Theme
The big thing was that we just wanted food to be a significant part of the game

## Gameplay
The objective is to protect a table of food that was made for dinner while enemies try to eat it
You shoot enemies with food from your gun before they eat your food

## Impediments
We didn't have too much of an issue since we had the assets and knowledge of coding

## Implementation
We made our own assets
We had the player be able to move around using your mouse to aim your gun
